= Daftly Opinionated Puppet Environment

**Fork this repository on GitHub, clone it on your local machine, and read
on to quickly get up to speed in setting up a new Puppet infrastructure.**

Once you're working in your own fork of the project, go edit this file
(README.md) and _replace_ the first paragraphs with your own introduction
so that all users of your infrastructure will feel properly addressed.

== Preparing For Development

Instead of a Rakefile (or a Makefile even), there are scripts for the most
important tasks in the `script` directory.

To prepare your development environment, simply execute `script/bootstrap`.

== Further Reading

The file doc/opinions.md explains some of the opinions that led to the
choices made in building this infrastructure.  Have fun, and consider to
edit doc/opinions.md and weigh in with your own opinions!
